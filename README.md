# week3-ac4

User story:

As a class member, I want to input data about my name, the number of pets I own, and a fun fact about myself and log that introduction to the console. 
Then I want to log a message to introduce my partner by reassigning the variables.


Acceptance Criteria


It's done when I store a name in a variable called personName and this line is logged to the console: "My name is VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_NAME."


It's done when I store a number in a variable called pets and this line is logged to the console: "I have VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_PETS pet(s)."


It's done when I store a fun fact in a variable called funFact and this line is logged to the console: "Fun fact: VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_FUNFACT."


It's done when I reassign the values of personName, pets, and funFact with my new partner's information and the logs in the console reflect the new values.

Variables declared must be:

personName
pets
funFact
